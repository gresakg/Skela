# Skela
### A simple boilerplate to start web projects

Skela is a collection of libraries you will probably need for an average web frontend. I have chosen this librairies according to my experience and my everyday needs.

The goal of Skela is to be responsive and cross browser compatible including IE 7.

### Included librairies

The main part of the project is a fork of [dmur's fork of Skeleton](https://github.com/dmur/Skeleton) merged with the fluid branch so that it has both 960 and fluid grid options.

Other librairies are:

- common [jquery v.1.10.2](http://jquery.com/download/)

- my branch of [leanModal.js](https://github.com/gresakg/leanModal.js)

- my [Share Free](https://github.com/gresakg/ShareFree)

- the beautifull [jQuery Cycle2](http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/)

And more will come.

Nothing except the skeleton and jquery is called by default making the base page super light. You include just what you need to.

*Skela* means scaffold in bosnian construction jargon.
